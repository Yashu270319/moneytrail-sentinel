    """
    Constructs a directed graph representing the money trail.
    
    Each node represents a user (sender or receiver).
    Each directed edge represents a money transfer from sender â†’ receiver,
    annotated with total amount and a list of involved transaction IDs.

    Args:
        transactions (List[Dict]): List of validated transaction dictionaries.

    Returns:
        nx.DiGraph: A directed graph modeling money flow.
